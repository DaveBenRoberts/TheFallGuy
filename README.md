TheFallGuy
==========

An infinite parallax site that has a guy falling in the middle. His state changes based on user scroll.

There are 4 different stages of the falling that loop.

Outer Space --> Blue Skys --> Earth (underground) --> Earth Core (Lava) --> loop back

When the user scrolls down the page, The "Fall Guy" has a falling animation. Whe they scroll up, he has a floating animation. When there is no scroll, the Fall Guy has a floating animation (re:floats - Still unsure about this, might have an auto scroll going)
